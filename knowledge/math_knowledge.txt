Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series.
                    
The derivative measures the rate of change of a function. For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) represents 
the instantaneous rate of change at point x. It is defined as: f'(x) = lim(h->0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

The integral is the reverse operation of differentiation. The definite integral of f(x) from a to b represents 
the area under the curve between those points.

Linear algebra deals with vector spaces, linear mappings, matrices, and systems of linear equations. 
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. It provides a mathematical framework 
for quantifying uncertainty. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1.

Statistics involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. Descriptive statistics summarize data, 
while inferential statistics make predictions based on samples.

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted to the study of integers and integer-valued functions. 
Prime numbers are fundamental in number theory.

Topology studies properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations. It is sometimes called 
rubber sheet geometry.

Graph theory studies graphs as mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. 
A graph consists of vertices connected by edges.
